LswApiCallerBundle
==================

![screenshot](http://www.leaseweblabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/api_caller.png)

The LswApiCallerBundle adds a CURL API caller to your Symfony2/Symfony3 application.
It is easy to use from the code and is aimed to have full debugging capabilities.

[Read the LeaseWebLabs blog about LswApiCallerBundle](http://www.leaseweblabs.com/2013/01/symfony2-bundle-for-curl-api-calling/)


## Requirements

* PHP 5.3 with curl support
* Symfony >= 2.1

## Installation

Installation is broken down in the following steps:

1. Download LswApiCallerBundle using composer
2. Enable the Bundle
3. Make sure the cURL module in PHP is enabled

### Step 1: Download LswApiCallerBundle using composer

Add LswApiCallerBundle in your composer.json:

```js
{
    "require": {
        "leaseweb/api-caller-bundle": "*",
        ...
    }
}
```

Now tell composer to download the bundle by running the command:

``` bash
$ php composer.phar update leaseweb/api-caller-bundle
```

Composer will install the bundle to your project's `vendor/leaseweb` directory.

### Step 2: Enable the bundle

Enable the bundle in the kernel:

``` php
<?php
// app/AppKernel.php

public function registerBundles()
{
    $bundles = array(
        // ...
        new Lsw\ApiCallerBundle\LswApiCallerBundle(),
    );
}
```

### Step 3: Make sure the cURL module in PHP is enabled

On a Debian based distribution (like Ubuntu) the package is called "php5-curl" and
can be installed using the following commands:

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install php5-curl
$ sudo service apache2 restart
```

On a RedHat based distribution (like CentOS) the package is called "php-curl" and
can be installed using the following commands:

``` bash
$ sudo yum install php-curl
$ sudo service httpd restart
```

To check this create and run a PHP file with the following contents:

``` php
<?php phpinfo() ?>
```

It should display that the option "cURL support" is set to "enabled".

This package should work on a Windows installation as well provided the CURL support
is enabled in PHP.

## Usage

You can use the caller by getting the service "api_caller" and using the "call" function with one of
the available call types:

- HttpGetJson
- HttpPostJson
- HttpPostJsonBody (the body will be json_encode)
- HttpPutJson
- HttpDeleteJson
- HttpGetHtml

Example of usage with the "HttpGetJson" call type:

``` php

use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller
use Lsw\ApiCallerBundle\Call\HttpGetJson;

class SomeController extends Controller
{
    public function someAction()
    {
        ...
        $output = $this->get('api_caller')->call(new HttpGetJson($url, $parameters));
        ...
    }
}

```

Example of usage with the "HttpPostJsonBody" call type:

``` php

use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller
use Lsw\ApiCallerBundle\Call\HttpPostJsonBody;

class SomeController extends Controller
{
    public function someAction()
    {
        ...
        $arrayToPost = array(
            'ip_address' => array(
                'name' => 'IpName',
                'hostname' => 'HostName',
                'ip' => '192.168.0.1',
                'throttling_template' => array(
                    'name' => 'Throttling Template'
                )
            )
        ); // this will be json_encode. If you don't want to json_encode, use HttpPostJson instead of HttpPostJsonBody
        $output = $this->get('api_caller')->call(new HttpPostJsonBody($url, $arrayToPost, true, $parameters)); // true to have an associative array as answer
        ...
    }
}

```

## Configuration

By default it uses these cURL options:
``` yaml
parameters:
    api_caller.options:
        timeout: 10  # maximum transport + execution duration of the call in sec.
        ssl_verifypeer: false  # to stop cURL from verifying the peer's certificate.
        useragent: "LeaseWeb API Caller"  # contents of the "User-Agent: " header.
        followlocation: true  # to follow any "Location: " header that the server sends.
        sslversion: 3  # set to 3 to avoid any bugs that relate to automatic version selection.
        fresh_connect: false  # set to true to force full reconnect every call.
```
